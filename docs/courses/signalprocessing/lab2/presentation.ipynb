        "It depends of the frequency resolution that we want. This is logical, since $dF = \\frac{F_s}{N}$, and that $N$ has been multiplied by 2 without changing $F_s$. **By increasing the duration of observation of the signal, we increase the number of samples and we decrease the frequency resolution**. To have a finer frequency resolution without changing the sampling frequency, it is therefore necessary to increase the size of the observation window, and therefore the number of samples: this is called windowing."
