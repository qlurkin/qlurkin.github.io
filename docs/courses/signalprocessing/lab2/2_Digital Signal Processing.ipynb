        "Let's start by **scaling the x-axis**: We know that by providing $N$ temporal data to the FFT algorithm, we obtain $N$ frequency data. We also know that the highest frequency component that could be observed is determined by the Nyquist frequency $F_N$ which depends on the sampling frequency of the time signal: $F_n = \\frac{F_s}{2}$. This frequency component will be observable for a positive frequency, but also for a negative frequency (remember the vectors rotating in both directions, paragraph 1 of this Notebook). The width of the frequency range covered is therefore equal to 2 times the Nyquist frequency, so it is equal to the sampling frequency $2F_N = F_s$. Knowing that we have $N$ frequency data, we can calculate the spacing between these data: $dF = \\frac{F_s}{N}$. This is the **frequency resolution** that we calculated in the previous paragraph."
