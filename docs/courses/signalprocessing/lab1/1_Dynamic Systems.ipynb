This amounts to linearizing this system and allows to use all the theory related to transfer functions. This linearization approach is the one most frequently encountered in industry. Let's remember that the most frequent objective in industry is to control a system with a controller. And it turns out that the LTI tools allowing the implementation of this control are much more understandable and simple to implement than the non linear techniques, which explains why these solutions are preferred.*\n",
