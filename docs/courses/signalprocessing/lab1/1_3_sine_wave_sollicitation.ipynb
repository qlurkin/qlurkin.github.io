    "- Use this Bode's diagram to plot the system's steady state response using a sample time of 50 ms. Remember the system is LTI and thus respects the superposition principle, so the global answer is the sum of the answers to each sine wave.\n",
    "- Compute the total transient duration based on the location of the system poles.\n",
    "- Simulate the time-related response (as well transient as steady state) using the relevant Python function (`forced_response`). Ensure the total simulation duration allows to have the whole transient as well as at least one complete period of the steady-state answer.\n",
    "- In the 2 previous results, isolate one period of the fondamental wave in steady state, and superimpose the 2 curves. (FYI, method one is `frequency_response` and method 2 is `forced_response` commands)."
